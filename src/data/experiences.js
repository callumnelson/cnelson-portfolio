Especially in my last few months at ERS, I had seen the massive potential for impactful, data-driven tools in the education space and wanted to be able to build them myself. In June, I will complete a 420+ hour program focused on product development fundamentals, object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks, data modeling, and team collaboration strategies. I am excited to see where these skills take me!`,
