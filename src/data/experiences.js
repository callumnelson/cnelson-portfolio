    description: `In the Spring of 2023, I decided to pivot back to my computer science roots. Especially in my last few months at ERS, I had seen the massive potential for impactful, data-driven tools in the education space and wanted to be able to build them at scale myself. In June, I will complete a General Assembly's 420+ hour Software Engineering Immersive program focused on product development fundamentals, object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks, data modeling, and team collaboration strategies. See my portfolio below for some examples of my latest projects.`,

Teaching remains the hardest job I've ever had, and though I loved the students and my colleagues, I felt like I was underutilizing significant parts of my skillset, which led me to pursue a more data-focused, quantitative role.`,
